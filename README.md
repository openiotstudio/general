# About Open IoT Studio

> Mozilla's Open Internet of Things Studio is a professional learning network committed to making IoT more open. We collaborate on prototypes that serve local communities and celebrate the unique affordances of physical places. We test and critique best practices for embedding privacy, digital literacy and diversity & inclusion in IoT. We publish and exhibit our results as a way to reflect and advocate for these values as the internet evolves into more physical and ubiquitous forms. 

The internet is changing forms. Today we live in a network of physical objects and services that continuously gather data and exchange it over the internet. These connected systems are increasingly invisible, inaccessible and immutable to us.

We believe that as the internet evolves, it must remain a global public resource, open and accessible to all.  

The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the trend of increasingly connected objects and environments. It's rapidly growing, although its professional practices and leading products are not yet fully established.

Mozilla seeks to make IoT more open, accessible and empowering. We also strive to improve privacy and security in the field. To this end, Mozilla is convening a global network of professionals committed to open IoT. 

Mozilla's Open Internet of Things Studio invites participants to collaborate on prototypes that serve local communities and celebrate the unique affordances of physical places. We test and critique best practices for embedding privacy, digital literacy and diversity & inclusion in IoT. We publish and exhibit our results as a way to reflect and advocate for these values as the internet evolves into more physical and ubiquitous forms. 

We prioritize working with professionals who are currently active in IoT: product designers, web developers, hardware manufacturers, data scientists, user researchers, and internet activists. 

We strive to welcome diverse thinking, identities and experiences. We care about sustainable activities, meaningful contributions to local communities, and a nurtured approach to innovation. We are committed to learning by making and to sharing what we know and create. 

This program is part of Mozilla's Leadership Network.
