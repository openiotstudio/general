# Located Thinking

*Interview with Jon Rogers conducted by Babitha George at the Scotland Design Sprint, June 2016.*

*Q: What’s this event all about?*

I’m wondering if this is an event. Events feel like they have a start and end to them - that they have a point. When Babitha, Michelle and I started out on thinking about how we could convene people around open IoT, it was clear that it was really all about the journey. About knowing that we are not ‘getting’ anywhere, and it is not going to be clear. It is about the atmosphere, the environment and the attitude. And we have got to this nature of a journey through various iterations. 


First up the Unbox Labs Caravan 01 where we deliberately went super open on where people might go—with very little direction or facilitation provided. In the Berlin Connect Home Sprint for Caravan 02, we went in the other direction and provided a clear set of briefs to build prototypes. In this third caravan in Anstruther, Scotland, we attempted to set out a new direction that was informed by the the two previous ones. 


Looking back on this week’s journey, it feels as if the direction has emerged from the following values:


* Diversity is key - diversity in people, in processes and technologies. 
* Critically positive framework for reflection
* Not having a goal in sight (else we would only deal with things for the now)
* Celebration of individuality & personal expression, which also equals messiness
* Patience with this messiness and chaos
* Beauty and celebration 
* Clever people who are also nice


*Q: What’s the point of all this?*
 
We are attempting to break away from this business of Silicon Valley and their language of agile prototyping and failing fast. That doesn’t mean anything in our contexts. It is instead about being flexible, adaptive and empathetic where you are working in tune with the people you are with. I have a problem with the word disruption; no-one here wants to be disrupted. Yes, of course, we need to work hard and work quickly, but the things we are dealing with can’t happen quickly. We can have a hackathon for climate change, but these are complex problems, and nothing is going to change in a couple of days. 


*Q: Why in Anstruther?*

Which brings me to what it means to locate an event like this in a place like this. 

For me, it is a very clear personal point of difference about “innovation” and the way it is going right now. Globally, this trend of innovation labs are becoming characteristic of glossy places in posh parts of cities, giving visitors this “amazing” experience of life that in reality is a sanitised version of real life. This is a pretty inhuman way of working, and we wanted to bring something here into the infrastructure that has always existed. Town halls and village halls were built with this incredible purpose of public good, especially for times of extreme emergency. 

Nowadays, we all seem to think we are all fine, but we are actually going into real crises, whilst these civic places are now crumbling. We wanted to locate us back here in these real spaces. It immediately locates you in the community; all around in these places there is art, painting, photos, knotting and embroidery that has been done by the community over decades, and possibly centuries and not installations that have been done by the latest, trendiest ‘artists’. This helps us to not forget where we come from and connect to the community via these. The internet doesn’t know how to do that, but village halls do and by being here, we are immediately saying that (without actually saying it). 

It was our intention from the start to get the baseline for our visitors to be an amazing experience—to make it feel memorable and inspiring. People need great food, they need breaks, they need to not be working all the time, they need locally resourced forms of entertainment (with the clarity that they can opt out!). People need nice places to stay in. If they came on holiday to this town, they would find a beautiful seaside fisherman’s cottage and that is what we found for this event too.

And even within this local environment we need to set things up to make people feel safe and comfortable. Within Dreel Halls, having the upstairs room for the lab made the techies feel at home, while the ground floor was open, with sticky notes, connected to the outside, with kids around. And it's really important to have connectivity between the two as well allowing people to model each space in the way they want to. 

If I were to write some guiding principles based on this - it might go something like this:

* You are here
* Be mindful and respectful 
* Look around you
* You aren’t anything special, you are part of the tide of life
* You are passing through
* Put people in homes, not hotels
* Build the event from local resources 


*Q: What have we learnt about approaching IoT from within Anstruther specifically?*

The findings from Jayne, Peter, Holy, Sean and Erika when they visited the boat builders and realised that technology was really not wanted there taught us something - that for a boat to work you need to be able to fix it. To trust a boat, you need to know what to do if it breaks down or starts leaking. That fundamentally, fixability and reusability are ultimately there to build trust and a sense of security. It is such a simple metaphor that is so right for the work we are doing too. 

Let’s not forget that we are human! So much of the Silicon Valley approach attempts to remove the human, building a dirty culture of lack of respect for land, history, people. Everything is new and in the “here and now” and we are all shiny and let’s get on with it. But anyone who is not under 35, who might have had health problems, is not from a privileged background knows that the world is not so shiny. Making things shiny and regular do make designing a lot easier but do they make for better design? We don’t think it does and we know the answers lie between us all rather than in one specific place (hence the continually shifting caravans) and why we work together. This is also the idea of things like UnBox where we know we don’t need a schedule, but we need a framework, and environments to learn in and playgrounds and a sense of purpose. 

And to do that it is really important to set up collaborative opportunities with spaces like the local people  and things specific to their lives—to find people and places that don’t necessarily want new technology but instead to find champions within like Jude Thomas, Sam Parsons and Sean Dooley who have helped to take people out into their world and experience it in a very authentic first-hand way. 

Putting together events like this are really about the people and the place. Over the many events we have done together, we have figured that our philosophy and approach won’t work with the wrong people or with corporate approaches. Diversity is key along with a critically positive framework for reflection, for this ‘un-process’ of professionals emerging and doing things their own way. 

*Q: Doing things differently next time…?* 

We should think about how can we enable things to be made within the sprint locally? Maybe we don’t need to hire (or in this case travel to a makerspace - which is awesome but took us away from the community we were designing with). If we had more time and resources maybe we could have set up with local boat-builders and metal-workers, cabinet makers, painters...etc.
