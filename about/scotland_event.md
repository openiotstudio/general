# Scotland Design Sprint: Concept

### Our Connected Communities: Collective Empowerment with IoT 

*Design Sprint in Anstruther, Scotland. Monday, June 20 - Friday, June 25, 2016*

## Purpose

As part of Mozilla’s exploration of the Internet of Things, we’ll convene leading practitioners to respond to a clear design brief about how communities can be empowered collectively by using IoT and open practices. 

The Scottish design sprint is about actively involving communities to explore IoT and make technology alongside them so it fits their lives. 
The goal will be to have several working prototypes that reflect the design brief and deepened understanding of what it’s like to build experiences based on user research. 

At the end of the Scotland event, we will leave with concrete next steps for testing and refining the prototypes, including at the Mozilla Festival in London in November. 

## Outcomes

* A collection of ethnographic community publications that exemplify a new way of open source ethnographic design research practice.

	* Considerations: privacy 
	* Community consent
	* Scalability of in-depth on-off research studies 
	* Dynamic ethics - how do permissions change over time? 
	* How can we share research outputs in a useful and shareable, responsible way. 

* Several functioning prototypes that respond meaningfully to the communities of Anstruther.
* Clear next steps for how the prototypes will be tested and refined over the following months, with supporting documentation on how they can be used and recreated.
* Published reflections and exit interviews with each participant about what it’s like to respond to user research and design briefs, and recommendations for how to improve insight gathering for future events. 
* Deepened relationships among the participants and shared paths for their continued collaboration in this project and the Mozilla Leadership Network. 
* These prototypes may also build upon projects and insights from the Berlin Connected Home Design Sprint, the Unbox Caravan in Ahmedabad, or programs like the Connected Devices Participation efforts and the Community Innovation Launchpad, as well as other initiatives participants are involved in.
