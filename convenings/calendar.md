# Convenings

A living calendar of the Open IoT Studio's events, either as host or participant. 

## Why convene?

Gather smart, interdisciplinary practitioners to prototype and innovate with open values. Building prototypes is better, faster, and more impactful when people are together. We want to invite new partners to take action with us–designers, technologists, activists, educators and more–as well as collaborate with Mozillians such as the Connected Devices team, Participation team, and others in the Mozilla Leadership Network.

## Past convenings

### [Unbox Caravan](https://medium.com/the-unbox-caravan)

At the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, India from Feb 1–13 2016. Participants across disciplines of creative technology, design, art, urban planning kicked off projects and collaborations.

Hosted by Quicksand's Unbox Labs.  

### [The Good Home](http://thegoodhome.org/)

The Good Home project explores ideas for 21st century urban living. We are building a pop-up urban living unit for the 21st century. In an on-going series of installments it will explore what life for a technologically-savvy household could look like while they are (and sometimes aren’t) at home in the near future. We will showcase how flexible living interacts with the limitations of diminishing household budgets, limited global resources, evolving concepts of privacy, the sharing economy, and global migration.

Hosted by Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino and Peter Bihr. 

Exhibited at: 

* [Mozfest 2015](http://thegoodhome.org/mozfest/)
* [Milan Fuori Salone 2016](http://thegoodhome.org/milan/)
* [London Design Festival 2016](http://thegoodhome.org/ldf-2016/)

### Berlin Design Sprint

As part of Mozilla’s exploration of the Internet of Things, we’ll convene leading practitioners from Friday, April 22 - Monday, 25, 2016 to respond to clear design scenarios about how users can understand and control personal data in the connected home. The Berlin design sprint is about making prototypes. Before arriving in Berlin, participants will be given insights based on user research and expert interviews and generate ideas in collaboration with other participants. The time spent in Berlin will be honing these ideas by implementing them in objects and experiences. 

The goal is to have several working prototypes that reflect the design scenarios and deepened understanding of what it’s like to build experiences based on user research. 

Hosted by Michelle Thorne and Jon Rogers at Fablab Berlin. 

### [ThingsCon Amsterdam Salon](http://www.thingscon.nl/salons/3-salon-dance-like-nobodys-watching/)

On June 10, 2016 in Amsterdam we’ll discuss what makes a desirable IoT for consumers, citizens, but is equally an arena to do business. How should we think about privacy? What is the user experience for consent? And how do we create a smart city that works for everybody?

Expect a Salon where we will discuss ethics in a pragmatic manner, where we learn from each other and foremost work towards a more responsible way to create IoT products.

This Salon is hosted by the Just Things Foundation. 

### Mozilla All-Hands London

* Participated in [innovation ideation skill-building sessions and hackathon](https://mozillalondonallhands2016.sched.org/?s=innovation).
* Hosted [Drop-in Physical Prototype Clinic](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/MoFoLondon/issues/39)

### Scotland Design Sprint

As part of Mozilla’s exploration of the Internet of Things, we’ll convene leading practitioners in Anstruther, Scotland from Monday, June 20 - Friday, June 25, 2016 to respond to a clear design brief about how communities can be empowered collectively by using IoT and open practices. 

The Scottish design sprint is about actively involving communities to explore IoT and make technology alongside them so it fits their lives. A key output will be a collection of ethnographic community publications that exemplify a new way of open source ethnographic design research practice. These will consider privacy, community consent and control, scalability of in-depth research studies, dynamic ethics (how do permissions change over time?) and how can we share research outputs in a useful and shareable, responsible way. 

Hosted by Jon Rogers and Michelle Thorne at the Dreel Hall and University of Dundee Makerspace
