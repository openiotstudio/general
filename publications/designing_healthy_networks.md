# Designing Healthy Networks

*Interview of Michelle Thorne, conducted by Babitha George during the Scotland Open IoT Design Sprint, June 2016.*

Q: Why did you organize this event?

This design sprint in Scotland is part of a larger effort exploring the Internet of Things. 

It’s opportunity to **find allies who care about shared values**—such as digital literacy, privacy, diversity & inclusion, open innovation and decentralization—showing up in emerging technology. 

We’re here to **leverage IoT as a tool for social impact.** We want to demonstrate how these values can be embedded in our work and furthered in what we make. 


Q: Who’s here and why?

I see the participants here as a **professional learning network.** We’re all working in the field of IoT in a professional capacity, be that as researchers, designers, technologists or internet activists. 

**The norms of IoT are not yet established.** Through collaboration, we develop shared practices and understanding of what it looks like to better embed these values in the technology we build. 

In this way, this event is all about **learning-by-making and building a network** through collaboration and making something meaningful together. By making a prototype together or project you start to form bonds. These bonds form a network. 

As a participant, there might be a skillset or mode that is comfortable for you—such as being a coder or user researcher. You’ll have honed your craft in that field. Then the balance at an event like this is how do we **help you do what you do best, but also support you to learn new skills.** 

Q: How do you facilitate an exchange like that?

There is a favourite quotation I have from the team at Aspiration Tech, **“Freedom in a framework.”**

When organising something like this, it is important to help people succeed by **offering a framework for participation but also giving permission to break it.** Our role as organizers is to suggest parameters, yet encourage people to create new ones. 

In this way, you can make the process of the event be part of the event’s goals. Here we’re striving for relationship building, with emphasising shared values, peer learning and building interdisciplinary practices. **An outcome for the event is positive indications of a healthy network.**

Q: How has this event evolved as a reflection of previous events?

We’re learning from each event we’ve organized so far. Feedback is dynamic, and **we want to have the network inform and be informed by these events.**

In Berlin in April 2016, we arrived with some design scenarios prepared. The participants really appreciated the anchoring and jumping off point. The attitude was “let’s start to make things.” We had fewer days, so this approach helped us move quickly while still having rich contexts to be inspired by. 

In Scotland, we decided to take a step back, and **invite the participants to discover their own scenarios** by doing research themselves. 

The teams were also quite static in Berlin. We did some match-making, thinking about how to set the table and who might work well together. People stayed in their teams throughout the whole event. But soon it reached its limitations. 

**We learned that it’s helpful to have groups form and dissolve over the course of the event.** That’s why the Scottish event is now more fluid in terms of group formations.

Furthermore, in Berlin we didn’t have the voice of any users in the room. We were being inspired by Berlin but not building for Berlin.

This event is quite different. **We have teens  as active participants. We went out and met boat builders and farmers.** This has given us a richness and texture that is a big improvement and given more purpose to what we build.

Q: How are these events understood and championed at Mozilla?

These formats are unusual within Mozilla. That’s because historically, we’re an organization that has primarily defined itself in software and technology products. **With software, especially when it’s used by millions of people, there is almost a hubris in thinking that there is a universality in the world.** 

Also, because you are working digitally a lot, you are kind of disembodied. **These sorts of events helps Mozilla find its body.** That practice has been growing in different forms with a lot with colleagues that have been doing similar work, particularly in the US and Canada, focusing on cities as hubs and networks. 

**Anstruther is a great complement Mozilla’s urban efforts.** The challenges of rural life are things like intermittent connectivity. The village context provides a richness that is different from city-life. It’s important to consider that when learning and making technology, especially for social good. 

As for how to take these event formats forward, **we have invited colleagues to come and experience the events.** They in turn have gone on to become champions internally. We’re also trying to get better at documentation, so we can tell this story. 

And lastly, the quality of the ideas and the relationships matter. If we have indications of a healthy network in action, that makes the case to continue this work. **And the ideas generated here are very different from those that might have come out of an anonymous hotel meeting room.** 


Q: What is the value of a “slow convening”?

Particularly in Silicon Valley, there’s an obsession with “fail fast.” It uses hackathons and sprints in a way that’s not necessarily a good thing. 

**We are often failing fast with other people’s lives.** It seems reckless, especially if you are trying to do things for others. There’s a need to be supportive and nurturing.

We are here to learn by making and shape professional practice. Therefore, we have to think about learning in more holistic and reflective way. 

**An event like this requires meta-cognition.** You have to realize the event isn’t just about making a prototype, but about shaping your practice and contributing to a larger community. **For that, reflection is vital.**

I liked how at the UnBox Caravan, we spent the last day in writing and reflection. From there, I have been inspired by the idea of the Slow Convening. **It’s about taking the time to listen, observe, be in a place, be present in your practice. You can still be rapidly prototyping, but with a slow philosophy.** As a person who has organized a lot of events, that has been really inspiring. 

Q: What’s been difficult about these events?

One thing I have struggled with is the idea of networks and the role an event’s host organization. 

I would love the group’s feedback on **what does the voice of the event host (in this case, Mozilla) look like in these networks.** 

What are effective ways to position the host organization? What are people looking for from the host, and what are they interested in contributing back? How do various collective identities play out? 

You don’t want to put a big banner around everything people do. You want to be allies and work alongside others. 

**Instead, we all see the opportunity for a network of professionals to positively shape IoT in the decade to come. That’s why we have to learn how to work together that leverages our respective expertise and further our agendas while helping us all grow and become more effective advocates together.**
