# Open IoT Studio: Half-time Report

In the first half of 2016, Mozilla's newly minted program for Open IoT placed its effort in three areas: people, process and prototypes.

The goal was to catalyze a group of collaborators to test out what Mozilla’s voice in the internet of things could be.

Prototypes served as a “collaborative substrate” for network members as they formed production-driven relationships and learned how to influence IoT together. 

We aimed for positive product interventions around privacy, digital literacy and decentralization. These prototypes were informed by community research in real contexts and user needs. 

An example of this in practice: in June, we teamed up the Raspberry Pi Foundation with Mozilla's Connected Devices to work with local Scottish youth. Together they repurposed public phonebooths and make a teen-controlled local network for their village, featuring gaming content made by the young people. 

With three convenings completed so far in India, Germany, and Scotland, we’re fine-tuning an event model we believe can bring a lot of success for the rest of the year and beyond.

We’ll also pilot collaboration across the Mozilla Leadership Network and deepen the work between MoFo and MoCo, especially in the Berlin office. In parallel, we want to secure funding through strategic partnerships and inaugurate an advisory group. 

Our focus now is to tell the story of what’s been made and learned so far through. This includes showcases at leading museums, such as the London V&A during Digital Weekend, publications online and in print, and feeding into shared Mozilla documentation systems. 

Here's an overview of what we’ve learned and where we’d like to go next: 

* **Open innovation.** Necessity is the mother of all invention. The pressing issues of our era are political, social, environmental and economic. As such, the technology we make must take on the challenges of our time. However, technology is not neutral—it embeds values and propogates power. To create change, we must analyze power structures and enact our values in what we build. If we want a more equitable world—where access, knowledge and capabilities are distributed equally and fairly—then we must embed those practices in how we work. Openness is a commitment to sustainable and egalitarian innovation.   
* **Located learning.** Technology embeds values and propogates power. Currently, this power is centralized by a handful of companies located in a handful of places. We  must understand where technology is made, by whom and for whom. And because we believe in a more equitable world, it is essential to make technology for and with people not in the centers of power. Our practice must be decentralized. By locating learning and making in a specific place, we can respond to local affordances and challenges in a meaningful, authentic way. These insights can then be shared globally and adapted by the network in other locations.
* **Diverse thinking and inclusive practices.** Relatedly, our practice must be inviting and rewarding to diverse participants. It must honor the uniqueness of each of our experiences and expertise, while cultivating a common cause that gives us shared focus and impact. Just as we analyze the power structures of technology, we must critique our own efforts and organizations towards more welcoming collaboration and inclusive projects.   
* **Literacy through legibility, fixability and participation.** To be able to read, write and participate with technology is essential to participating fully in society today. In the technology we build, and the practices we cultivate, we strive to ensure that complex systems become legibile, so that they may be comprehended, and to modifiable, so that they can be fixed and adapted to better serve the people using them.  
* **Privacy, user control and collective control.** Learning about technology and achieving equitable participation in society requires the ability to think and express yourself on your terms. That includes the right to have private communications, so that you can learn and discuss safely and without self-censorship or fear of judgement. It means having spaces in your life where you can control your image. Similarly, as you participate in communities and groups, there must be ways to communicate amongst yourselves. 

These themes represent how our learning as evolved since the start of the year. Looking back at early posts, we also stay commited to learning by making, networked action and co-design.
